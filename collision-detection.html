    <!-- More about collison detection -->
    <!-- Collision detection is important when you want to build javascript games and you need to detect when two elements collide or when you are 
    building particle system when object interact with each other or may be you want your canvas element to interact with your regular website element
for most projects we need collision detection algorithms between two rectangles or between two circles for more complex shapes we need collision detection techniques called seperating axis theorem
it can be used to detect collision between two convex polygons or rectangles that are rotated and arent axis aligned you might have also some specific needs for your game or creative coding projects some other
scenarios are collision detection between point and circle point and square between line and circle. It becomes more complex when the shapes such as 
convex and concave polygons are detected such as detecting collision between colors or detecting points for many games you nedd to create a generic shape 
around our object which are known as hitbox main advantage is code is very simple and performant because it doesnt require any complecx calculation thsese hitboxes 
The shape of the hitboxes may be rectangle, square the simplest collison algorithm is between two rectangles atht are axis aligned It means they are not rotataed it simply compared x and y coordinates and width and height of thes etw o rectanges
if they overlap then there is a coliisiom and if tehre is no overkap there is no collision  -->
